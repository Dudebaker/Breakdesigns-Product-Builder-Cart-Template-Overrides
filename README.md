# Breakdesigns Product Builder Template Overrides

The Breakdesigns Product Builder does not deliver template-overrides to group the configurated products in the cart.<br>
They are all shown as independant products as the user had added them manually.

With these template-overrides the configurated products are grouped together.<br>
Additionally the quantity-change and remove-from-cart options are removed for the configurated products.<br>
In this way the user cannot mess with the configuration and can only remove the whole configurated product.<br>

### Currently the following overrides are done:

- Virtuemart 
  - Version 4.4
  - Default Layout
  - Bootstrap 5 Layout

- VP OnePageCheckout Plugin
  - Version 7.28
  - Normal Layout
  - Narrow Layout

- Rupostel OnePageCheckout 
  - Version 2.0.452.100125
  - Theme yootheme_2col

- VP Neoteric Template
  - Version 1.9

<br>

Each overrides has as base the original version and the changes can be compared (directly in github) and adopted to other templates/extensions/plugins which create the cart layouts.
